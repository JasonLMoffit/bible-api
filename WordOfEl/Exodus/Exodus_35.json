Exo 35:1-35  Moses assembled the entire congregation of the Israelis and told them, "These are the things that the LORD has commanded you to do:  (2)  For six days work is to be done, but on the seventh day you are to have a holy day, a Sabbath of complete rest in dedication to the LORD. Anyone who does work on that day is to be executed.  (3)  You are not to light a fire in any of your dwellings on the Sabbath."  (4)  Then Moses told the entire congregation of the Israelis, "This is what the LORD has commanded,  (5)  'Take from among yourselves an offering for the LORD. Everyone whose heart is willing is to bring it as an offering for the LORD: gold, silver, and bronze;  (6)  blue, purple, and scarlet material; fine linen and goat hair;  (7)  ram skins dyed red, dolphin skins, acacia wood,  (8)  oil for lighting, spices for the anointing oil and for aromatic incense,  (9)  onyx stones, and stones for setting in the ephod and the breast piece.  (10)  "'Let everyone who is skilled among you come and make everything that the LORD has commanded:  (11)  the tent, its tent, its covering, its clasps, its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets,  (12)  the ark, its poles, the Mercy Seat, the curtain,  (13)  the table, its poles, all its furnishings, and the bread of the presence,  (14)  the lamp stand for light, its furnishings, its lamps, and oil for the light,  (15)  the altar of incense, its poles, the anointing oil, the aromatic incense, and the screen for the doorway at the entrance to the tent,  (16)  the altar for burnt offerings, the bronze lattice for it, its poles, and all its furnishings, the basin and its base,  (17)  the hangings for the court, its pillars, its sockets, the screen for the gate of the court,  (18)  the pegs for the tent, the pegs for the court, and their cords,  (19)  the woven garments for ministering in the Holy Place, the holy garments of Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons for serving as priests.'"  (20)  Then the entire congregation of the Israelis withdrew from Moses' presence,  (21)  and every person whose heart moved him and all whose spirits prompted them, brought an offering to the LORD for constructing the Tent of Meeting, for all its service, and for the holy garments.  (22)  Both the men and women came, all whose hearts prompted them, and brought brooches, earrings, rings, pendants, and all kinds of gold jewelry. Every person presented a wave offering of gold to the LORD.  (23)  Everyone who had blue, purple, and scarlet material, fine linen, goat hair, ram skins dyed red, and dolphin skins brought them.  (24)  Everyone who could give an offering of silver and bronze brought it as a contribution for the LORD. Also all who had acacia wood for any use in the work brought it.  (25)  Every skilled woman spun with her hands, and brought what she spun: blue, purple, and scarlet material, and fine linen.  (26)  All the women who were skilled artisans spun the goat hair.  (27)  The leaders brought onyx stones and stones to be set in the ephod and the breast piece,  (28)  spices and oil for the light and for the anointing oil and the aromatic incense.  (29)  Each Israeli man and woman whose heart was prompted brought something as a freewill offering to the LORD for all the work which the LORD had commanded them to do through Moses.  (30)  Moses told the Israelis, "Look, the LORD has called Uri's son Bezalel, grandson of Hur, from the tribe of Judah,  (31)  and he has filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, and with knowledge of all kinds of work,  (32)  to make artistic designs, to work in gold, silver, and bronze,  (33)  to cut stones for setting, to carve wood, and to engage in all kinds of artistic work.  (34)  And he has given both him and Ahisamach's son Oholiab from the tribe of Dan the ability to teach.  (35)  He has equipped them to do all kinds of work done by an engraver, designer, embroider in blue, purple and scarlet material and in fine linen, or as a weaver. They were able to do all kinds of work and were skilled designers.
