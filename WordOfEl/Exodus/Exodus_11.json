Exo 11:1-10  Then the LORD told Moses, "I'll bring one more plague on Pharaoh and Egypt. After that he'll let you leave from here, and when he lets you go, he will certainly drive you out from here.  (2)  Tell the people that each man is to ask his neighbor and each woman her neighbor for articles of silver and gold."  (3)  The LORD made the Egyptians look on the people with favor. Also the man Moses was highly regarded in the land of Egypt, both in the opinion of Pharaoh's officials and in the opinion of the people.  (4)  So Moses announced to Pharaoh, "This is what the LORD says: 'About midnight I'm going throughout Egypt,  (5)  and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt will die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne to the firstborn of the slave girl who operates the hand mill, along with the firstborn of the animals.  (6)  There will be a great cry throughout the land of Egypt, like there has never been and never will be again.  (7)  But among the Israelis, from people to animals, not even a dog will bark, so you may know that the LORD is distinguishing between the Egyptians and the Israelis.'  (8)  All these officials of yours will come down to me, prostrate themselves to me, and say, 'Get out, you and all the people following you!' After that I'll go out." Then Moses angrily left Pharaoh.  (9)  The LORD told Moses, "Pharaoh won't listen to you. As a result, my wonders will increase throughout the land of Egypt.  (10)  Then Moses and Aaron did all these wonders in front of Pharaoh, but the LORD made Pharaoh's heart stubborn, and he would not let the Israelis go out from his land.
