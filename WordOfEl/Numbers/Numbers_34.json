Num 34:1-29  The LORD told Moses,  (2)  "Issue these orders to the Israelis: 'You're about to enter the land of Canaan. This territory has been apportioned to you as your inheritance: the entire land of Canaan, all the way to its borders."  (3)  "'To your south is the Wilderness of Zin, bordering Edom. Your southern border is to extend east toward the far end of the Dead Sea,  (4)  then it is to turn southward to the ascent of Akrabbim, cross Zin, and then run south of Kadesh-barnea and proceed from there to Hazar-addar and across to Azmon.  (5)  Then the border is to turn from Azmon toward the wadi of Egypt and from there to the Mediterranean Sea."  (6)  "The western border is to be the Mediterranean Sea. This is to be the western border."  (7)  "Your northern border is to extend from the Mediterranean Sea to Mount Hor.  (8)  From Mount Hor, you are to mark out the entrance to Hammath, with the border running through Zedad,  (9)  then through Ziphron, and then to Hazar-enan. This is to be the northern border."  (10)  "You are to mark the border on the east from Hazar-enan to Shepham.  (11)  The border is then to extend from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain, then to the Sea of Chinnereth on the east.  (12)  The border is to continue along the Jordan River all the way to the Dead Sea. This is to be your land, as measured by its boundaries."  (13)  Moses commanded the Israelis, "You are to inherit this land by lot, just as the LORD commanded to give it to the remaining nine and a half tribes.  (14)  The tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, as defined by their ancestral houses, have received their inheritance.  (15)  These two and a half tribes received their inheritance this side of the Jordan River, east of Jericho, facing the rising sun."  (16)  Then the LORD told Moses,  (17)  "These are the names of the men who are to divide the land for your inheritance: Eleazar the priest and Nun's son Joshua.  (18)  You are to appoint a leader from each tribe to divide the land for inheritance.  (19)  "These are the names of the men: Appoint Jephunneh's son Caleb from the tribe of Judah,  (20)  Ammihud's son Shemuel from the tribe of Simeon;  (21)  Chislon's son Elidad from the tribe of Benjamin;  (22)  and Jogli's son Bukki is to be leader of the tribe of Dan.  (23)  "From the tribe of Joseph, you are to appoint Ephod's son Hanniel to be leader of the half tribe of Manasseh;  (24)  Shiphtan's son Kemuel to be leader of the half tribe of Ephraim.  (25)  Parnach's son Elizaphan to be leader of the tribe of Zebulun;  (26)  Azzan's son Paltiel to be leader of the tribe of Issachar;  (27)  Shelomi's son Ahihud to be leader of the tribe of Asher;  (28)  and Ammihud's son Pedahel to be leader of the tribe of Naphtali."  (29)  These are the ones whom the LORD commanded to divide the inheritance of the Israelis in the land of Canaan.
