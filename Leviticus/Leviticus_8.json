(1)  The LORD spoke to Moses:  (2)  "Take Aaron, his sons with him, the clothing, the anointing oil, the bull for sin offering, two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread  (3)  and then assemble the entire congregation at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.  (4)  So Moses did just as the LORD had commanded him. He assembled the congregation at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.  (5)  Moses told the congregation, "This is what the LORD commanded to be done."  (6)  Moses brought Aaron and his sons and washed them with water.  (7)  Then he clothed Aaron with the tunic, girded him with the band for priests, clothed him with the robe, placed the ephod on him, girded him with the skillfully weaved band of the ephod, and bound it on him.  (8)  He set the breastplate on him and placed the Urim and Thummim on top of the breastplate.  (9)  Then he set the turban on his head, and on the turban at the front he set the golden plate, the sacred crown that the LORD had commanded.  (10)  After this, Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tent, consecrating everything that was in it.  (11)  He spattered some on the altar seven times, then anointed the altar, all its vessels, the laver, and its base to consecrate them.  (12)  He then poured the oil of anointing on Aaron's head to anoint and consecrate him.  (13)  Then Moses brought Aaron's sons, clothed them with the tunic, girded them with the bands, and bound turbans on them just as the LORD had commanded Moses.  (14)  Next, he brought the bull for sin offering. Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the bull's head for a sin offering.  (15)  So Moses slaughtered it, took the blood, and poured some of it at the horns of the altar and around it with his fingers, thus purifying the altar. Then he poured the blood at the base of the altar, thereby sanctifying it as a means to make atonement with it.  (16)  Moses burned on the altar all the fat on the internal organs, the appendage on the liver, the two kidneys, and the fat.  (17)  As to the bull and its fat, skin and offal, he incinerated them outside the camp, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.  (18)  Next he brought the ram for whole burnt offering. Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.  (19)  Moses slaughtered it and poured its blood over the altar and around it.  (20)  As to the ram, he has cut it into parts at the joints. Moses burned the head, internal organs, and the fat.  (21)  Moses washed the internal organs and the thigh with water and then burned the entire ram on the altar as a whole burnt offering, a pleasing aroma of an offering made by fire to the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.  (22)  Moses brought the ram, that is, the second of the rams for consecration. Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.  (23)  Moses then slaughtered it, took some of its blood, and put it on Aaron's right earlobe, right thumb, and on his right great toe.  (24)  Then Moses brought Aaron's sons, took some of its blood, and put it on their right earlobes, on their right thumbs, and on their right great toes. Moses poured the blood on the altar and all around it.  (25)  Then he took the fat—from the tail, all the fat on the internal organs, the appendage of the liver, the two kidneys with the fat, and the right thigh.  (26)  From the basket of unleavened bread, which is in the LORD's presence, he took one piece of unleavened bread, one cake spread with olive oil, and one wafer, which he placed over the fat and the right thigh.  (27)  He put all of these things in the hands of Aaron and his sons, and they all waved them in a raised offering to the LORD.  (28)  After this, Moses took those things from their hands and burned them on the altar over the whole burnt offering for consecration. They served as a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the LORD.  (29)  Moses took the breast and waved it as a raised offering in the LORD's presence as the portion that belonged to Moses from the ram of consecration, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.  (30)  Moses took some anointing oil and blood that was on the altar and spattered it on Aaron, on his clothes, on his sons, and on their clothes, consecrating Aaron, his clothes, his sons, and their clothes.  (31)  Then he told Aaron and his sons, "Boil the meat at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. There you may eat it along with the bread that is in the basket for consecration, just as I've commanded when I told him, 'Aaron and his sons may eat of it,  (32)  but the leftover meat and bread is to be incinerated.'  (33)  "Furthermore, you are not to go out past the entrance to the Tent of Meeting until the days of your ordination have been completed, since it will take seven days to ordain you.  (34)  What has been done today has been commanded by the LORD to make atonement for you.  (35)  Stay seven days and nights at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and attend to the service of the LORD, so that you won't die, because this is what I've commanded."  (36)  So Aaron and his sons did everything that the LORD had commanded through Moses.
